## Experience

Since fall 2011 I’ve been employed as an implementation engineer with [AOS](http://www.aos5.com) in Overland Park, Kansas. Prior to that I worked as a system administrator for [Perceptive Software](http://www.perceptivesoftware.com), and before that I worked as an network analyst for [Rockhurst University](http://www.rockhurst.edu).

While working for RUCS during the summer of 2008, I spearheaded their VMware based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure deployment, which rolled out hundreds of VDI based thin clients to all campus computer labs. This project ended up garnering the attention of various vendors and partners, as well as the local and tech press, and was later featured in publications and case studies. This led to world wide attention, generating requests for my advice on virtual desktop from other schools (and even some companies) from as far away as Fiji.
