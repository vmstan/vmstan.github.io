title: Keeping USB drives clean with BlueHarvest

I’ve long been annoyed with copying files to a USB stick, and then handing them to a Windows user (typically a customer) and then telling them to ignore all the .whatever files that are created.

Recently I found [BlueHarvest](http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest/), which runs $15 and has a 30-day trial, and it’s appears to be the new solution to my problem. It automatically cleans the OS X specific files on any non-Mac formatted (exFAT, FAT32) drive that enters the system.

The results have been great, and my portable drives are now very clean.

I used to have a menubar application called [CleanMyDrive](http://macpaw.com/cleanmydrive) by MacPaw that would get rid of these, but at some point I quit using it for reasons I don’t even remember. I think the menu bar icon was kind of ugly on Yosemite+ (yes, I’m that picky.)
