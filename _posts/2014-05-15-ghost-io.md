This blog is powered by [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org). What exactly is Ghost? I covered that over [in a post](http://vmstan.com/another-day-another-cms/) back in December when I moved to it, but the short of it is it's a streamlined CMS that focuses on composing posts using Markdown.

Because I'm not able to live with anything on this site for very long (as documented by the 4 previous reconfigurations I've done) I've moved the blog from it's previous setup of a dedicated Rackspace Cloud VM to Ghost's hosted site.

It's a little bit slower, but it's less to manage. It's also cheaper. And, I can take my data and go back to hosted if I end up hating it.

I also added a new theme from called [Peeves](https://github.com/mholland1337/Peeves), which is a slight tweak of the old one with some new features and includes a links/social sidebar.

The biggest addition though, is comments are back, powered by Disqus.
