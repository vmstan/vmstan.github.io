I'm taking a Facebook Vacation.

I've logged out from every device, removed the apps, the bookmarks, integration to operating systems.

The duration will be as long as I can swing it. There may be a point at which I can't take it and come crawling back. I wouldn't say I'm having withdrawal, but when I woke up this morning and got on my phone, the first thing I would normally do would be to open the app.

It wasn't there.

Lately I've just felt overwhelmed by the noise. I feel like at times I just contribute to it, and need to find a way to make it better for myself. I can still keep up with sharing photos with friends on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/vmstan). My wife is addicted, so she can be my source for actual news of importance about friends and family who don't share it with me directly. I want to see what it's like for a while without the need to know, without the sometimes the overwhelming chatter.

And of course I still have [Twitter](http://twitter.com/vmstan). Which strangely enough, I don't consider that noisy even though I follow 1500 people. Twitter is like a stream full of conversation, compared to Facebook which is individuals yelling as loudly as they can at me.

I'm tired of the yelling.
