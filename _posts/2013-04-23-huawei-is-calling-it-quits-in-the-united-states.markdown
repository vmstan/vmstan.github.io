Probably because most US businesses were not to excited to base their infrastructure on the technology of a company that stole Cisco code, and is run by former members of the Chinese military. Not too long ago Sprint and Softbank had to agree to a request by the US intelligence community to rip and replace any Huawei equipment they had on the Sprint network as a condition for their upcoming merger.

I've actually only heard first hand of one my customers with Huawei devices in production, and oddly enough it was their storage system (which until that point I didn't even know they had a hand in.) Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see what it looked like.
