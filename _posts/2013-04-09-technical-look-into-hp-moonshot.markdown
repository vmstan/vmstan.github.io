I was planning on writing up my thoughts about the new HP Moonshot, but after reading [@ChrisWahl](http://twitter.com/chriswahl)'s, I decided not to reinvent the wheel. [Check it out here.](http://wahlnetwork.com/2013/04/09/a-technical-look-into-hp-moonshot/)

It'll be interesting to see how this product plays out. 45x Intel Atom processors in a 4.3U enclosure (odd size, I know) with 500GB SATA drives. Strange stuff.
