> Engineering teams have traditionally been split between program managers, developers and testers. Yet with_ **_new cloud methods_** _of building software, it often makes sense to have the developers test and fix bugs instead of a separate team of testers, Nadella said in the interview last week. Some of the cuts will be among software testers, said one of the people.

I’m not a developer, but how does “the cloud” change the dev/test process in this way?

And as Rick Scherer pointed out this morning:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cloud has jumped the shark, Whoopi Goldberg on The View is talking about The Cloud. I&#39;m done, no more cloud talk for me.</p>&mdash; Rick Scherer (@rick_scherer) <a href="https://twitter.com/rick_scherer/status/489096830018269185">July 15, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

(BTW, none of this has anything to do [CloudShark](https://appliance.cloudshark.org), the product, that is actually a pretty neat way of storing and sharing packet captures.)
