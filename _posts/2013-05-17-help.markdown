*Congrats, if you can see this your DNS is seeing the latest and greatest host records.*

I just can't help it, I'm such a geek. Last year, when I started this blog, it was originally going to be fully coded and updated using an engine called Second Crack, instead of something more traditional like Wordpress. 

After spending a lot of hours getting it to work how I wanted, I then did a complete 180 and switched everything over to Wordpress. Not only did I switch to Wordpress, but fully hosted Wordpress.com. At first it was OK but I kept running into things I wanted to do but that I couldn't. 

So now I'm switching blog engines *again*, but this time to Octopress.

It's going to take me some time to get all the previous posts converted and looking a little cleaner. Please hang in there. I'll get things sorted out this weekend.

The new site sits on a Rackspace VM running Ubuntu 13.04, powered by Lighttpd. Since Octopress pages are all statically generated HTML, resource usage is very light. There is no PHP, CGI, SQL, or anything happening on the server except serving up static content. This makes the server more secure and the site less vunerable to attack, it also means I can pay for a cheap VM without having to worry that it'll get taken down under heavy load.

Now if only I could figure out how to get enough traffic for some heavy load.
