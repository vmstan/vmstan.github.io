Seeing [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/stop/status/322140733895225345) the other day made my weekend. It's totally worth doing, and really surprising to me why this isn't the default on the Mac. Font's go from looking fuzzy and bloated to being crisp and clean. Apparently it's turned off by default for those of you lucky enough to be carting around a Retina MacBook Pro.
