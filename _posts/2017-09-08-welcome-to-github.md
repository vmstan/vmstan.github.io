If you’re reading this, you’re viewing my blog content that has been moved from Medium to GitHub Pages. This marks yet another time I’ve moved the content out of one CMS and into another. I’m not sure that I’ve accounted for all the ways I’ve made myself do this, and in what order, but I’ve now powered this place on at least:

* Second Crack
* Octopress
* Wordpress.org 
* Wordpress.com 
* Ghost (self-hosted)
* Ghost Pro
* Medium
* GitHub Pages

This was really done as an experiment to force myself to learn Git. It has the added benefit of allowing me to go back to writing site content in Markdown, as I did with Second Crack, Octopress and Ghost. 

I doubt it’ll be the last time the content migrates. I still have some cleanup to to do, around CSS and some page layout. I’m also not happy with the home page listing as it stands now, so expect some changes there over the next week or two.
