I'm moving my blog (still powered by Ghost) from their managed "Ghost Pro" service to a dedicated virtual machine hosted through DigitalOcean.

All of my text content has transferred over, but Ghost Pro doesn't have an automated way of getting the images out of the hosted service, so please excuse any missing graphics for the time being. I have a support ticket in to get the images.
