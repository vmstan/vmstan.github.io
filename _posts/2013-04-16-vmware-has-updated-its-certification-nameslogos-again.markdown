According to Eric Sloof, [VMware has updated its certification names logos and logos](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/2328-The-new-official-VMware-technical-certification-logos-and-names-are-out.html), again.

I guess nothing lives forever, nothing stays the same.

What was the VCP until September of last year was originally going to be the VCP-DV, is now the VCP-DCV. The VCP-DT is still the VCP-DT, but the master level certification, the VCDX, has become the VCDX-DCV. Logos have also been updated. "Data Center" is now two words instead of "Datacenter" because apparently that considered industry standard (I didn't realize there was such a thing.)

Good thing I was waiting to order new business cards until after I could add a VCAP certification.
