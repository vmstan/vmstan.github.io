This one dropped in my Inbox this morning, nice way to start the day.


> Due to the overwhelming popularity and increasing demand for RecoverPoint certifications, the EMC Proven Professional program will introduce two new role-based RecoverPoint Specialist-level exams for the Implementation Engineer (EMCIE) track.

>The EMC Product/Technology Specific E22-275 RecoverPoint Data Replication and Recovery Exam will retire on March 31, 2013.

>We have excellent news for EMC Proven Professionals with RecoverPoint Data Replication and Recovery credentials!

>The EMC Product/Technology Specific E22-275 RecoverPoint Data Replication and Recovery Exam will retire on March 31, 2013, however your EMC Proven Professional RecoverPoint Data Replication and Recovery credential will not expire. You will continue to gain access to exclusive program benefits.

>Additionally, provided you hold a valid prerequisite credential, you will be granted an Implementation Engineer (EMCIE) RecoverPoint or Implementation Engineer (EMCIE) RecoverPoint/SE Specialist-level certification credential! The process of granting Implementation Engineer (EMCIE) credentials will begin on January 4, 2013.


From what I understand, since I’m both EMCISA and EMC VNX IE certified, I will receive both the RecoverPoint IE and RecoverPoint/SE IE certifications. Can’t complain about that.
