[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2015/05/29/why-not-google):

> _… the reason I choose to minimize Google’s access to me is that my balance of utility versus ethical comfort is different. Both companies do have flaws, but they’re different flaws, and I tolerate them differently:_

> _Apple is always arrogant, controlling, and inflexible, and sometimes stingy. Google is always creepy, entitled, and overreaching, and sometimes oblivious._

> _How you feel about these companies depends on how much utility you get out of their respective products and how much you care about their flaws._

> _Simply put, Apple’s benefits are usually worth their flaws to me, and Google’s usually aren’t._

[Rene Riche](http://m.imore.com/apple-customers-look-google-io-2015):

> _Both Apple and Google have been stating their corporate goals with increasing frequency, including during their respective keynotes. Both are worth comparing and contrasting._

> _Apple’s is to make great products. Google’s is to organize the world’s data._

> _Expanded, that means Apple needs to enter categories where the company believes it can make a substantial contribution through really great products it can sell to a select segment of the market._

> _Google needs to convince everyone on earth to hand over all of their data so Google can organize it and make it accessible to everyone else on earth._

> _Apple funds its strategy by selling those great products at substantial margins. Google by selling advertising against, and intelligence obtained from, the data._

> _Everything Apple says and does on stage is designed to get you to give them money for a product, and to enjoy it so much you want to keep giving them more money for subsequent products._

> _Everything Google says and does on stage is to get you to give them more data, and to enjoy it so much you want to keep giving them more data._
