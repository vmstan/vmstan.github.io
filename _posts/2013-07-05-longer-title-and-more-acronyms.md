There is no other purpose for this entry, except for some shameless self promotion. I’m pretty excited about both of them, as they’re the results of things I’ve been working on for a while. Even though I love to talk about myself, I’ll keep it short and sweet.

*   Last week, I was promoted to Sr. Systems Engineer with AOS. No doubt that the recent vExpert award played into this, but I also like to think it was the result of proving myself over the last two years to managers, co-workers and customers.
*   On Wednesday, I passed the first test for my CCNA (adding “CCENT” to my resume in the interim). Getting my CCNA done has been on my to-do since about 2007ish. Hopefully sometime soon I’ll be able to report on passing test #2 and finishing that up.

At the end of this month, I’ll be traveling to Washington, DC, for week long training on CommVault, since my company is going to start selling their solutions soon. This means more studying, more classes, and more testing/certifications. When kids say things like “I can’t wait to be done with school so I don’t have to study anymore” I’m quick to point out I do more homework now, then I probably did then, and with far more responsibilities along with it.

Learning never stops, and if it does, you’re doing it wrong.
