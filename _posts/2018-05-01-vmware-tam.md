I have accepted a job with VMware, as a Technical Account Manager (TAM).

To say I'm excited about this would be a gross understatement. VMware has been the company I've spent the majority of my technical focus on up to this point, and since announcing this change on Twitter last week I've been thrilled with the replies like "I've been here 4 years and it's an amazing place to work." During the interview process, one of the current TAM's told me point blank: "This is the best job I've had in my career." All of this has maintained a level of anticipation about this career change that I've not had for any other.

It's not as if this is a surprise because I interact with so many great people on a regular basis who work for VMware, who seem to genuinely love the work they're doing. But it's been refreshing to get the same messages from people I'd never even met before. I've never worked for a vendor before, and reguardless of the company I had reservations before going this route. Would I lose my independent voice? I've had opportunities to make the switch arise before, but didn't always see myself as a fit because the product itself didn't engage me in any meaningful way. 

I think Keith Townsend nailed it the other day when he said: 

> [‚ÄúOne of my principles throughout my career has been the ability to present the most appropriate technical solution to a business challenge. If I ever go work for a vendor it will be because I believe in the product.‚Äù](https://twitter.com/CTOAdvisor/status/988840975144509440)

The last year has been a rebuilding year, for me. In early 2017, [I left my role as an data center engineer](https://vmstan.com/an-end-and-a-beginning/) at a _Value Added Reseller_, to go back into a customer role. I had been working as a consultant for nearly six years, but prior to that I spent seven years on the customer side. So now I was back working 9-5, at the same desk. It was tough because I loved consulting, and I literally couldn't wait to get back, but for various reasons I needed the transition. The role I took was intentionally outside my comfort zone, to force myself to do something different and pickup new skills. It was challenging in ways both expected and unexpected. The team I was working on has some great people, and it has been a fun to work with them, even if all the while I knew this wasn't the place I wanted to stay at for very long.

This year in transition was a change that I needed, being a customer was a place to lay low, reset, and figure out my future and my priorities. There was no travel and no on-call, not even an expectation to even have email on my phone, let alone respond after hours to it.

But now I'm back, and ready to get to work doing what I love, for the company that I've spent the last decade focusing on, in the company of all the great people who've helped me get to this point.
