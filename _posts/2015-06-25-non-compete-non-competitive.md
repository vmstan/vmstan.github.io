> Some tech companies attempt to impede the natural flow of talent by tying the hand of employees with non-compete agreements. … It’s not hard to see why some companies like them. The whole point of these agreements is to discourage employees from seeking greener pastures.

> In truth, there is no free lunch. … Tempting though they may be, non-competes are bad for everyone they touch, employees and employers alike. … The bottom line is that non-compete agreements are bad for business. They are anti-competitive and anti-capitalist. … They reduce productivity, create labor market inefficiencies, depress wages and discourage innovation.
