I just flew back from Palo Alto where I’ve been attending the VMware Partner Technical Advisory Board on End User Computing. Prior to a couple of months ago, I’d never heard of a PTAB, and then I got invited to one.

The purpose of the PTAB is for VMware to invite services partners out to meet with VMware leadership to discuss the future of their products and to provide **very candid** feedback. There is also chance for training, as I was able to attend a free two-day ICM class on Horizon Mirage.

While the actual content of the PTAB is under NDA, I will say that VMware has some really exciting things happening in the EUC space. I had a great time, VMware puts on a nice show. The moment I realized I was sitting in the VMware headquarters eating bacon, I felt like royalty.

It was also a great chance to do some networking and meet people that I only previously had a chance to know on Twitter… including the vExpert Godfather, Mr. [@jtroyer](http://twitter.com/jtroyer).

Last but not least thanks to people like [@BChristian21](http://twitter.com/BChristian21) [@DavesRant](http://twitter.com/DavesRant) [@rockygiglio](http://twitter.com/rockygiglio) [@jaslanger](http://twitter.com/jaslanger) [@keithnorbie](https://vmstan.com/ptab/%28http://twitter.com/keithnorbie%29%20%5B@broets%5D%28http://twitter.com/broets) [@thombrown](http://twitter.com/thombrown) [@earlg3](http://twitter.com/earlg3) and the others who let me tag along in the evening and share sushi, milkshakes, chowder and beer. Every night I felt like I was drenched in knowledge just being able to listen and share feedback between the group.

If I ever needed inspiration to start evaluating my professional future and to go for my VCDX, this was the group to do it.

I’m looking forward to another oppertunity to attend in the future.
