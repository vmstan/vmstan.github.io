Wednesday I had the chance to spend the whole day soaking in knowledge. Always a welcomed event. This time it centered around Cisco Meraki.

As an employee of a Cisco Premier partner ([AOS](https://www.aos5.com)), and a current CCNA, I was able to attend this one day boot camp on Meraki and earn their Certified Meraki Networking Association ([CMNA](https://meraki.cisco.com/cmna)) designation.

Other things you get for attending the class:

*   CMNA polo shirt
*   MX60 security appliance
*   MS220–8P switch
*   MR26 wireless access point
*   Lunch

Lunch was delivered today. The shirt and kit get shipped to me, and I can’t wait to get my whole home network setup on it and really start playing.
