</blockquote>Once upon a time there was a meeting of minds</br>
The sun and the moon made a deal with the sky</br>
One would take the morning and the other the night</br>
Together they would blanket the world with light</br>
But the moon had a shadow, he felt like a liar</br>
The sun was the only one who carried the fire</br>
The sun saw this, she kept on glowing</br>
Bound to the moon, never saying, "you owe me"</br>
She said I'll shine on you.</br>

Who will you shine on today?
