In order to make sure I'm GDPR compliant, or as close as one can be for a blog, this is my privacy policy.

I strive to collect as little data about you as technically possible. I do not have control of the servers where these pages are served (GitHub Pages) and have limited visibility into who is accessing these pages through the DNS/caching service that sits infront of those systems (Cloudflare).

I do not intentionally embed any social media tracking links. I embed tweets in posts from time to time. Twitter may be collecting data on you as a result of this, but I'm not. I do not run any commenting system on this site. I do not run Google Analytics or any package that tells me even something as basic as how many hits a page gets. I do not run advertisements on this site, or even do paid content. This doesn't mean I won't at some point in the future, and if I do, I do not intend to run anything that embeds code which I cannot directly control.

I don't care to know that much about what you're doing online, or on this site. For all I know, my traffic could be billions and billions of engaged technologists. It could be my wife and mother. 

I wouldn't know.
