title: VMware Fusion 5.0.3

This is a free upgrade to existing Fusion 5 users.

[**Resolved Issues**](https://www.vmware.com/support/fusion5/doc/fusion-503-release-notes.html)

* Added support for Boot Camp partitions on 3TB disk drives.
* Improved the cursor performance for select applications, especially when in Unity mode.
* McAfee AntiVirus Plus updated with Windows 8 support.
* Resolved an issue that could result in blurry graphics under certain circumstances.
* Resolved an issue that resulted in horizontal scrolling being reversed in Unity mode.
* Resolved an issue with displaying Office 2013 applications on some recent Macs.
* Improvements to vSockets.

**Known Issues**

* VMware Fusion users running OS X Mountain Lion are strongly advised to upgrade to OS X 10.8.3. Running VMware Fusion on OS X 10.8.2 can result in unexpected virtual machine crashes.

I'm excited to see if the Office 2013 update makes using Word and Outlook 2013 usable finally!
