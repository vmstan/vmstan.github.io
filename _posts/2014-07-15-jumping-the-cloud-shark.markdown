In [a Bloomberg article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-15/microsoft-said-to-announce-job-cuts-as-soon-as-this-week.html) on Microsoft potentally cutting jobs sometime this week:

> Engineering teams have traditionally been split between program managers, developers and testers. Yet with **new cloud methods** of building software, it often makes sense to have the developers test and fix bugs instead of a separate team of testers, Nadella said in the interview last week. Some of the cuts will be among software testers, said one of the people.

I'm not a developer, but how does "the cloud" change the dev/test process in this way?

And as Rick Scherer pointed out this morning:

(BTW, none of this has anything to do [CloudShark](https://appliance.cloudshark.org), the product, that is actually a pretty neat way of storing and sharing packet captures.)
