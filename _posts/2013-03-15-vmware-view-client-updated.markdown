Updated clients for VMware Horizon View have been released by VMware. These new clients are optimized for Horizon View 5.2, as well as the newly released View Feature Pack. With the additional Feature Pack agents installed you'll get access to your desktop via HTML5 (aka VMware's "Blast Protocol") as well as Unity Touch, which makes the experience of connecting to a Windows desktop from a touchscreen tablet like your iPad, a lot more fluid.

Windows client version is now 5.3, the Mac, iOS and Android clients are now marked as version 2.0. There is also a technology preview of a View Client (seen in screenshot above) in the Windows Store for use on Windows RT devices such as the Microsoft Surface. An updated Linux client will be available in the coming weeks.

Downloads for updated clients [can be found on the VMware website](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_horizon_view_clients/2_0)Â as well as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The View Feature Pack which includes the HTML and Unity Touch agents [can also be obtained on VMware.com](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VIEW-520-FP1&productId=320&rPId=3628) and requires the Horizon View 5.2 Connection Broker as well as the latest version of the View Clients to function.
