This weekend I decided to focus a little bit on branding, myself. I added a couple of new services to my portfolio and they have custom domains to go with them.

* **url.vmstan.com** is my new link shortner domain, powered by [Bitly](http://bitly.com). I will use this to automatically share new posts from the site, but also to share any other content I want to on social networking.
* **rss.vmstan.com/vmstan** is my new RSS feed, powered by [uri.lv](http://uri.lv). I'm fairly confident that Google is going to dump FeedBurner like its doing to Google Reader, so why not get ahead of the curve and subscribe to something not owned by Google.

Just trying to do whatever I can to ping myself out. I've been thinking a lot about getting a VMSTAN personalized license plate. But that would require a trip to the DMV... yuck.

Also, If you've not already found a replacement for Google Reader that you like, I highly suggest you checkout [Feedbin](http://feedbin.me).
