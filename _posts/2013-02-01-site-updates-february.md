I did a little freshening up of the site theme today. My original color scheme was a little too green for me, and it didn’t seem like the colors complimented each other well. I picked them off of a VMware branding guide originally, but they just didn’t look right in the way I was using them.

I found a neat site called [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/) that based on a color, will generate a range of complimentary ones from the wheel. The only color on the last design I liked was the one I was using for the links, so I based it off that.
