From Mitchell Cohen at [mitchchn.me](http://www.mitchchn.me/2014/os-x-terminal/):

> The OS X Terminal opens up a world of powerful UNIX utilities and scripts. If you’re migrating from Linux, you’ll find many familiar commands work the way you expect. But power users often aren’t aware that OS X comes with a number of its own text-based utilities not found on any other operating system. Learning about these Mac-only programs can make you more productive on the command line and help you bridge the gap between UNIX and your Mac.

I will admit that I only was aware of a couple of these,  but I've only been a Mac user for about three years.
