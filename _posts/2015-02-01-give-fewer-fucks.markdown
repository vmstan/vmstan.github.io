Pardon my language, or don't, for I've always thought the concept of "curse words" was stupid, and I just don't give a fuck. Last weekend in my Instapaper Weekly email, was a link to a fantastic article by [Mark Manson](https://twitter.com/@IAmMarkManson) called *[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck)*.

Take 12 minutes, and give it a read:

> Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given ... Fucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe?

> This is the problem, my friend.

> Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, thatâ€™s when life fucks us.

As Mark points out, not giving a fuck doesn't mean being apathetic, it means only caring about the things that really matter, and then not giving a fuck about what anyone else things in pursuit of that caring.

Ironically, the Instapaper Weekly email that came today included a mention about the language of Mark's article, and an apology.

> The top highlight in last week's email contained some... colorful language, and we're sorry if you were offended. The Weekly is an algorithmically generated newsletter based on the most popular articles & highlights saved by Instapaper users, and unfortunately we didn't build the algorithm to filter profanity in any way. We've added in some filters on our end to ensure that future content remains as interesting as ever, while avoiding any potentially offensive language. Again, we are sincerely sorry if you were offended, we're still getting the taste of soap out of our mouths! 

Perhaps if those people who were offended, spent some time reading the article, they would have realized there are more important things to give a fuck about. 

*Avoiding potentially offensive language*, what the fuck!?

I suggest a refresher on the history of the word.
