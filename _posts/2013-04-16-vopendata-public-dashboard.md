> **What is vOpenData?**
> vOpenData is an open community project that grew from the question "What is the average VMDK size for deployed virtual machines?" We wanted to create an open community database that is purely driven by users submitting their virtual infrastructure configurations. Leveraging the powerful virtualization community and applying simple analytics we are able to provide various trending statistics and data for virtualized environments. This is 100% community driven and the results will be available for everyone to view and hopefully you will contribute to the overall dataset!

> **What information do we collect?**
> We made an effort to not collect specific information such as hostnames or even display names that could be used to identify a particular organization. Instead, we are using UUIDs which are automatically generated by the virtualization platform to uniquely identify a particular object. This allows us to keep track of changes in the our database when a new data set is uploaded from an existing environment. In addition we are collecting various configuration data and you can find a complete list in the Data FAQs
