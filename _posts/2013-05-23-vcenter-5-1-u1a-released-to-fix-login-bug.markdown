title: vCenter 5.1 U1a released to fix login bug
date: '2013-05-23 17:00:00'

>vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1 has been removed from the VMware download site due to issues encountered when logging in to vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1 with domain credentials. vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1 is replaced by vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1a, which is functionally identical to vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1 and resolves the issue encountered when logging in to vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1 in a set up where the vCenter Server login domain user account is associated with a large number of domain groups and multiple domains are configured as SSO identity sources. See KB 2050941 and the Resolved Issues section of the release notes for more information.
