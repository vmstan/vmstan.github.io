I had some thoughts after reading [Chad Sakac’s blog](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2014/05/vnx-architectural-evolution-keeps-rolling-vnxe-3200-project-liberty.html) entry about the new VNXe 3200.

*   The original VNXe (3100/3150/3300) was not my favorite product. It was fine as far as entry-level storage goes, but there were a good chunk of restrictions on the product, both technical and artificial, compared to it’s “big brother” VNX.
*   I’m conversely more excited about getting into deployments of the VNXe 3200\. I’ll let you read Chad’s blog to get a more complete list of features but being able to do FAST Cache and FAST VP makes it a lot more of a compelling product.
*   I get the impression from reading Chad’s post that VNXe is reaching the point where the platform will eventually gain the ability to be as feature complete as the VNX and being built on the same hardware platform eventually perform as well as the VNX.
*   At some point, I would expect the “next-next-Generation VNX” to look more like a VNXe then the CLARiiON/Celerra mashup that exists today. No Windows code anywhere to be found, truely unified block and file setup.
*   If all they did was get rid of Java in the full VNX Unisphere mangement interface, I’d be so happy.
*   I suspect a lot of customers where a block-only VNX 5200/5300 made sense are going to be “moving down” to the VNXe.

Looking forward to getting my hands on one.
