[Interesting analysis](http://myvirtualcloud.net/?p=4976) by Andre Leibovici ([@andreleibovici](http://twitter.com/andreleibovici)).

I suppose if you disregard the jarring user experience in a business environment, Windows 8 has been shown to have fewer IOPS requests than Windows 7 by a fairly significant margin in the bootup process, and also when users login.

So, there is one good thing about Windows 8.
