Itâ€™s completely logical, and totally stands to reason, that after doing two vCenter 5.1.0a upgrade/installs last week that VMware would, on Friday, drop the code for 5.1.0b on me.

The official version information is vCenter Server 5.1.0b Build 947939, a couple of notable highlights from the [release notes](https://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere5/doc/vsphere-vcenter-server-510b-release-notes.html#resolvedissues) include:

* Timeout errors occurring when logging in to the vSphere Client have been addressed.
* You can log in to a vSphere Web Client as a user of an Active Directory domain that has a non-standard UPN.
