[Things are rough today at Emory University](http://it.emory.edu/windows7-incident/):

> A Windows 7 deployment image was accidently sent to all Windows machines, including laptops, desktops, and even servers. This image started with a repartition / reformat set of tasks.

>As soon as the accident was discovered, the SCCM server was powered off â€“ however, by that time, the SCCM server itself had been repartitioned and reformatted.

As a former university system administrator who may or may not have crashed an Exchange server accidentally during finals week, I feel for whomever is responsible for this mess.
