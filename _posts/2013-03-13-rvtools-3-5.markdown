RVTools is free, and just requires Microsoft .NET 2.0 or higher to be installed on the machine you're running it from. It pulls gobs and gobs of information about your vCenter environment and puts it into an easily exportable format for analysis.

It's one of those tools that make being a VMware administrator even easier.
