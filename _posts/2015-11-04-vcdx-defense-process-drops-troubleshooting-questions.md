Those who are looking to obtain the highest certification level in VMware’s portfolio, watch out, the company announced [in a blog post by Chris Colletti](https://blogs.vmware.com/education/author/chris_colotti) that they’ve made an adjustment to the process.

Gone is the final part of the defense, where in the last 15 minutes candidates would be given hypothetical troubleshooting scenarios. Instead, the time has been assigned to the ad-hoc design session. Additionally, the VCDX-Cloud and VCDX-DT scenario times have both been increased to 45 minutes to match VCDX-DCV and VCDX-NV timelines, for consistency.

Colette, who is currently a Principal Architect and VCDX Evangelist at VMware, explained that these changes have long been in discussion with the VCDX Advisory Council members and with many of the current VCDX panelists.

Previously candidates would defend one of their own designs that had been pre-submitted, vetted, and then invited to defend in front of a panel of veteran VCDX holders. Then the ad-hoc design session, followed by troubleshooting. This is after the candidate obtains multiple prior VMware certifications of VCP and VCAP/VCIX. The defense can only be done at pre-scheduled events such and usually involves a trip to Palo Alto, or another VMware corporate location. The process is somewhat unique in the industry.

Reaction from current VCDX holders in the community has been mixed on social media, but trending mostly positive.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I approve of dropping troubleshooting from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VCDX?src=hash">#VCDX</a> defense. Never felt it was a good fit.</p>&mdash; Jason Nash (@TheJasonNash) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJasonNash/status/661579975213101057">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Last week VMware announced a new crop of VCDX holders, bringing the total up to 213. The next defense is November 9, for VCDX-NV candidates, and February 15, for VCDX-DCV. Applications for the February defense are due by December 11, 2015.
