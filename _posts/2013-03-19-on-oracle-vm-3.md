> Oracle VM 3 improved a lot, they are not close to Microsoft or VMware, but it is pretty good if you are not trying to do dramatic things like moving virtual machines around.

Gartner's vice president and _distinguished_ analyst Thomas Bittman, [talking about](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/19/gartner_virtualisation_market_overview/) how Oracle VM is poised to be the _real_ competitor for VMware in the future. Not Hyper-V. Not Xen.

I'm not one to really defend Microsoft or Citrix, but... have you ever actually seen Oracle VM running on a production system?
