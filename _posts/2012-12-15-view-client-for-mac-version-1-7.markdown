> Previously, if you used the PCoIP display protocol on some Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) systems and displayed the View desktop in full screen mode, when you moved your mouse pointer to the View Client menu bar or toolbar at the top of the window, the pointer moved to the middle of the screen and you could not use the menu bar or toolbar while in full screen mode. This issue has been resolved. [Release Notes](https://www.vmware.com/support/viewclients/doc/viewclient-mac-release-notes.html)

If that was the one and only thing they did this new version for it would be a worthy upgrade. This behavior was driving me crazy!

However, the Mac client also now supports USB redirection. Bringing it ever closer to the feature-set of its Windows based big brother.
