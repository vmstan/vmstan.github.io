A few months ago when I launched this blog, I decided to try something fancy and use Marco Arment's [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) engine to power the backend. I'm a huge fan of [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com) and [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org), which are a couple of Marco's other projects. I figured Second Crack would be a fun way to learn new things, and it was. However recently I've decided I don't have a lot of time for new things that are not part of my core responsibilities. Learning to write CSS, hack together code, and maintain and secure a web server really are not part of that core.

Second Crack was neat in that it let me use Markdown files that I could put into Dropbox on my system and it would automagically turn that into website. Except it kept breaking on me. File permissions, Dropbox's client for Linux, Second Crack services. It really was just too much to keep up on for a little no-traffic blog. I decided this week after trying to post about the latest version of View and it not working that it was time to ditch it. I needed something:

  1. Bulletproof	
  2. Easy to update
  3. Near-zero maintenance required
  4. Social

I've used Wordpress a lot in the past, but usually self-hosted. This time around I'm going to use Wordpress.com and let them handle everything. We'll see how well it goes with me being stuck in their little box. I do like a little flexibility and customization. At least with this if I decide IÂ _need_ to break out, I can export the data and go. (Having to manually import all my previous blog data today was not fun. Thankfully the site is only a few months old.)

Anyway, thanks for visiting. Hopefully now that things are a little more stable I can update on a more regular basis.
