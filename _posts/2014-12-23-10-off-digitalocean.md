I mentioned in my last post that I've moved the blog over to DigitalOcean. I've used various virtual server providers for various incarnations of this site. (Amazon, Rackspace, I even flirted with Azure for a short time.)

However [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=22dc47ca50ac) is by far the easiest and cleanest setup. I've been incredibly impressed so far.

If you're interested in checking them out, you can use [my referral link](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=22dc47ca50ac) and get $10 off your bill.
