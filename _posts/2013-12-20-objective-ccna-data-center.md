For the next two weeks, while I'm on vacation and enjoying the holidays, I'm also going to be heads down in study for the **CCNA Data Center** exams.

I obtained my [CCENT back in July](http://vmstan.com/longer-title-and-more-acronyms/) but was side tracked by other things from plowing through and getting the second test done to get my CCNA R/S completed. After trying to get back into it, I just can't make it stick. I do very little with routing, and have background little knowledge in it. The DC exam was my eventual goal, so that's where I'm headed.

The dates for my two exams (640-911 & 640-916) are right after I get back from vacation. This gives me two weeks to get it done.
