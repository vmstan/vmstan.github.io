I wrote a [similar article](http://techvirtuoso.com/2010/12/08/get-the-most-out-of-evernote/) nearly three years ago over when I was spinning stories over at TechVirtuoso. The use cases and the number of users of the product has skyrocketed since then. I've had my account since nearly the first day I had an iPhone 3G.

Their premium offering got even better a few weeks ago when they started indexing the content of Office documents in addition to the usual PDF.
