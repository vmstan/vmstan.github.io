## Corporate Overlords

I'm currently a Technical Account Manager for **VMware** focused on healthcare clients. (Please note, all opinions expressed on social media are mine, and may not relect theirs.)

Prior to that, I spent a year working as an Integration Engineer for **DST Systems** which is a financial services and healthcare technology provider. As an IE, but primary function was to work directly with the company business units and help assess their infrastructure needs and design solutions for them that were consistent with the best practices established by the enterprise architecture teams. I supported our pharmacy solutions and business workflow automation groups. I put in my notice the same week [a transaction to purchase them](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ss-c-technologies-to-acquire-dst-systems-1515673275) was going through, for $5.4 billion. They're now owned by SS&C.

For six years I was a Sr. Systems Engineer for **AOS** which is now owned by ConvergeOne. I left a few months before they got bought. I did mostly VMware, Cisco and EMC data center consulting projects for them. What can I say? It was VAR life. If you're not sure what that means, I suggest listening to [episode 130 of the Datanauts podcast](https://overcast.fm/+E_k8gB8Qs) where the panel explains exactly what that means.

Prior to that, I was a Systems Administrator for a company called **Perceptive Software**, that company was purchased by Lexmark right after I started working for them, for around $250 million. Shortly after I left they rebranded the entire operation to _Lexmark Enterprise Software_ but then bought a competitor called Kofax for $1 billion dollars. Some Chineese investors bought Lexmark a couple years ago, and then divested all of the software. Kofax became a seperate company again, and the original company I worked for was sold to a different competitor called Hyland. I only worked there for a year.

For four years I was a Network Analyst for **Rockhurst University** which is a small Jesuit college in Kansas City. I did a bunch of crazy things there including one of the first major VMware VDI implementations in education. Wyse did a case study on it, and it won an award from ComputerWorld Magazine. Here's the video version, where you can see a very nervous, 40 pounds lighter, 25 year old version of me explain why desktop virtualization is great.

Rockhurst is still just Rockhurst.
