## Experience

I'm currently a Technical Account Manager for VMware focused on healthcare clients.

Prior to that, I spent a year working as an Integration Engineer for **DST Systems** which is a financial services and healthcare technology provider. I put in my notice the same week a transaction to aquire them was going through, they're now owned by SS&C.

For six years I was a Sr. Systems Engineer for **AOS** which is now owned by Converge One. The company had been around since the early 1990s. I left a few months before they got bought. I did mostly VMware, Cisco and EMC data center consulting projects.

Prior to that, I was a Systems Administrator for a company called **Perceptive Software**, that company was purchased by Lexmark right after I started working for them, for around $250 million. Shortly after I left they rebranded the entire operation to _Lexmark Enterprise Software_ but then bought a competitor called Kofax for $1 billion dollars. Some Chineese investors bought Lexmark a couple years ago, and then divested all of the software. Kofax became a seperate company again, and the original company I worked for was sold to a different competitor called Hyland. I only worked there for a year.

For four years I was a Network Analyst for **Rockhurst University** which is a small Jesuit college in Kansas City. I did a bunch of crazy things there including one of the first major VMware VDI implementations in education. Wyse did a case study on it, and it won an award from ComputerWorld Magazine. Here's the video version, where you can see a very nervous, 40 pounds lighter, 25 year old version of me explain why desktop virtualization is great.
