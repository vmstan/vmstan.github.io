resume: A while ago I decided to quit my job and leave college to become a self taught front end developer... and it's been quite a ride so far!

I'm currently focused on progressive web apps, tooling, tech writing and open&nbsp;source collaborations.

## Experience

I was lucky enough to be part of great companies like **Globant**, **Razorfish**, **Velocity Partners** and&nbsp;**Jam3**.

I worked with really smart and cool people in projects for **Google**, **Disney**, **Microsoft**, **StateFarm**, **Instagram** and&nbsp;**Facebook**.
