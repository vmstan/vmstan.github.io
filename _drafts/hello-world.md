title: Hello, World
---

As outlined [in my previous post](https://vmstan.com/in-re-doorbells/) I recently ditched a Ring 2 for the recently released Nest Hello. Again, to avoid unnecessary tweetstorms, here are my thoughts in a convenient bulleted list.
* It's great. I'm very happy with my decision.
You could stop there if you wanted to. But I'll continue.
* The overall industrial design of the Hello is superior to the Ring, in my opinion. The device is sealed, compared to the Ring which has a removable faceplate and battery. It makes for a tighter looking package.
* The video quality is night and day better. The Ring Pro does a better job than the Ring 2 that I had, but I can only compare to what I had, and it's instantly apparent after powering on the device.
* The people detection is great, and integration with the Google Home Mini that was included for free as part of the pre-order is pretty slick. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, if it can identify them and announce "Grandma is at the front door."
* The viewable image of the video is more square than the Ring was wide. This allows you to see more of the front porch to identify packages left by the UPS man. It does mean that some areas to the side of my front door that were previously visible on the periphery get cut off. I'm considering moving the location of my doorbell wiring closer to the door as a result.
